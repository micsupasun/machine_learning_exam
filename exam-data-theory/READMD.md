# Machine Learning exam

## Objective
The objective of this project is to evaluate and solve various machine learning problems using statistical analysis, linear algebra, and machine learning algorithms. The problems are designed to assess the understanding and application of key concepts such as probability, matrix operations, linear regression, logistic regression, clustering, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Step
1. Data Analysis and Probability Estimation.
2. Matrix Operations.
3. Regression Analysis.
4. Machine Learning Algorithms.
5. Data Preparation and SQL.

## Result
The results of this project will include:
1. Calculated Probabilities: Conditional probabilities and MLE values derived from given data.
2. Regression Models: Linear and logistic regression models with calculated coefficients, R-squared values, and other metrics.
3. Matrix Solutions: Correctly computed matrix operations, including multiplications, transpositions, and determinant evaluations.
4. Model Predictions: Outputs from CNNs and other machine learning models trained on provided datasets.
5. SQL Query Results: Correctly executed SQL queries for data manipulation and retrieval.
